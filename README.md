# Indian-kids-screen-time-excel
Exploratory data analysis and dashboard design in Excel to uncover patterns in screen time usage among Indian children, including gender, age, devices, and location trends.

## Problem Statement

Screen time affects childrenâ€™s health, behavior, and daily routines.  
In this project, I aimed to answer:

Do boys and girls, or kids from different backgrounds, spend screen time differently?
